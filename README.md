# BreastCancerSubtypeAnalysis

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of breast cancer subtypes using clinical and microarray gene expression data. It explores clustering, differential expression (DE) analysis, and survival modeling to identify biomarkers and pathways associated with breast cancer subtypes.

## Objectives
- **Subtype discovery**: Employ clustering methods to identify potential molecular subtypes of breast cancer.
- **Differential expression analysis**: Perform DE analysis using the limma package to identify key genes.
- **Pathway enrichment**: Conduct GO and KEGG pathway analyses for biological interpretation of DE genes.
- **Survival analysis**: Assess the clinical relevance of identified subtypes using Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier survival curves.

## Project Structure
- `Analysis of microarray gene expression data from 251 patients presenting with breast cancer.pdf`: Detailed report on methods, results, and conclusions.
- `BreastCancerSubTypes R Code.R`: R code for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
